def visual_question_answering(image_url: str, prompt: str):
    """
    Performs visual question answering using the 'sieve/llava-vl-13b' function from the 'sieve' library.

    This function takes an image URL and a text prompt as input. It processes the image and uses the prompt to generate a relevant response based on the visual content of the image.

    Parameters:
    - image_url (str): The publicly-available URL of the image to be processed for visual question answering.
    - prompt (str): The prompt or question based on which the response is generated, considering the image's visual content.

    Returns:
    - The response generated by the 'llava-vl-13b' model as a result of visual question answering.

    Note:
    - The function uses fixed values for 'top_p', 'temperature', and 'max_tokens' to control the generation process.
    - 'top_p' controls the diversity of the generated response, 'temperature' affects randomness, and 'max_tokens' defines the maximum length of the response.
